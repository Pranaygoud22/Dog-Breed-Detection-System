### Dog Breed Detection System
The **Dog Breed Detection System** is a machine learning-based application designed to identify the breed of a dog from an input image. This system leverages deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNN), to classify images of dogs into various breed categories with high accuracy.

## **Features**:

Image Input: Accepts a single image of a dog as input.

Breed Classification: Detects and classifies the breed of the dog from the image.

Deep Learning Model: Uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network for feature extraction and classification.

## **Dataset**

For this project, we have used the Stanford Dogs Dataset, which consists of images and annotations for 120 dog breeds.
