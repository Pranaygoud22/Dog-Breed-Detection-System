The Dog Breed Detection System is a machine learning-based application designed to identify the breed of a dog from an input image. This system leverages deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNN), to classify images of dogs into various breed categories with high accuracy.

Features :

Image Input: Accepts a single image of a dog as input.

Breed Classification: Detects and classifies the breed of the dog from the image.

Deep Learning Model: Uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network for feature extraction and classification.
